# Hello there! 

This is just a simple CLI based YouTube downloader using PyTube. It's more for my personal use, but I don't mind sharing it and developing it for myself as others to use. It's going to be built by me and maintained in my free time. Hope you find it useful!

# Why did I decide to build this instead of using a website?
The answer is simple! I am bored with trying to find the least sketchy YouTube video downloader to use which won't compromise my system with broken/corrupted files that could cause harm in some way, shape or form!
