# Logging system
The logging system would be indepth and mostly for troubleshooting and anyone who's tech-savvy enough to understand
what's happening. It would basically provide date, time, the process and a log of what was happening when the system is
running. It would be aiming to be fully anonymous, so I wouldn't get any sort of personal details about you from your
machine/PC.

# Searching Download system
The searching download system would allow you to download the videos from a selection via a unique number ID generated 
by the code. That would allow easy use for everyone who wishes to use it. It will allow you to search for playlists and
videos and **WILL** return a unique generated search ID, the video name, channel name and video URL allowing you to
download what you are wishing to download.

# Caption Download system
This system should allow you to download captions for videos with language codes ("en" for English for example). This
will sadly not be able to be used for *every* video as not all videos will have the language code or even captions.

# Other Websites
There is an idea I have considered over the time of including more websites than just YouTube including sites like
Dailymotion, TikTok and news sites just to name some with more that can be requested/added with pull requests by others.

# Other Platforms?
I have been considering bringing this out in an actual release onto other platforms such as iOS, Mac, Linux and Android.
I don't own any Apple devices, so I would be relying on the library to do most of the work for me unless contributors
assist with the project, and its other counterparts. As for now though, this is a pipe dream and something more long
term to work on for me.
